## **KPIS for Hotel Industry**

---
1.   Occupancy

>Occupancy rate refers to the number of available rooms in a hotel that are occupied at any given time. It can be used to assess how efficient a hotel is at making use of the space available and can be used on conjunction with other metrics to maximise revenue. The occupancy rate is expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing the number of occupied rooms by the total number of rooms.


2.   ADR

> The Average Daily Rate or ADR is a popular KPI for hotel industry. The ADR is the average rate at which each room at the hotel was sold on a given day. It is calculated by taking the Average room revenue and dividing it by the total number of rooms sold.
This, however, does not include rooms that are occupied by staff, under maintenance of the ones that are

3.   RevPAR

>RevPAR or Revenue per available room is another metric to measure the performance of the property in the hotel business which is very popular. The RevPAR metric helps in evaluating the hotel’s operational performance. This measure can further be used as a coach to make good future investment resolutions and meet the targets set. By finding out the RevPAR, the answer devised could act as a productivity indicator for a hotel investor. This also reflects how much a hotel can charge for its rooms and how successful it is at selling the inventory which is available

4. Average Length of Stay or ALOS

>The Average Length Of Stay is a kpi for hospitality industry metric which helps in making it easy to find out the length of stay of guests which are booked at your hotel. The ALOS metric is calculated by dividing the occupied rooms by a number of bookings. So if the number is high it means greater profit with requirements of very less labor. While if the number of the computed ALOS is low, it obviously results in lesser profit.

5. Total Available Rooms

>Total Available Rooms are the number of rooms which are readily there to be booked in the hotel. In order to compute the Total Available Rooms, you need to sum up the Available Rooms and also the number of Occupied Rooms.
This metric in kpi hospitality needs to be monitored as it is essential for the proper planning of your inventory which would further lead to proper number of room bookings.
